Blondin
=======

Balance incoming requests to ensure good service by buffering requests for slow/expensive resources.


Blondin is a lightweight HTTP proxy that is capable of throttling requests to a configurable subset of proxied resources.  

Blondin takes the form of a single executable jar, and may be started with the following command line:

    java -jar blondin-main-0.0.1.jar myconfig.properties

Configuration is achieved with the use of a properties file:

    # Blondin Core Configuration
    port=9999
    targetHost=localhost
    targetPort=8080
    expensiveResourcesUrl=file:///~/expensive.txt

    # Logging
    logDirectory=/var/log/blondin

    # Graphite Metrics
    graphite.host=metrics
    graphite.port=2013
    graphite.period=10

Blondin utilises a handful of special HTTP requests to allow remote control:

    GET   /status
    POST  /stop
    POST  /suspend

Colophon
========
Blondin is named after [Charles Blondin][blondin-wiki], a famous tightrope walker, who was unarguably good at balancing.
